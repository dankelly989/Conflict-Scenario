You are a MSF aid worker placed in a Yemeni hospital in Houthis occupied Saa’na during the civil war. The country is suffering due to blockade imposed by Saudi coalition, which has made it hard to bring in much needed supplies to hospitals etc. Presently the country is in an almost unprecedented Cholera epidemic, which is due to bacteria passed through contaminated water, and can cause death in the already weakened in a matter of hours. 
You are in one of the few remaining hospitals left in the city, with the rest having been destroyed by coalition air raids seeking to destroy Houthi strongholds. There have been rumors that several Houthis have been using the hospital as a base, which have made their way back to the coalition via their spy network. You are tasked with helping doctors perform necessary tasks, go find him and ask if he needs any help.
